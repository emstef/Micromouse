###### This project was developed for [COMP513](http://www.intelligence.tuc.gr/~robots/index.html): Autonomous Agents course @[TUC](https://www.tuc.gr/).  
# Synopsis
This project is an attempt to develop the Micromouse competition in Webots, a 3D robot simulator, for the purposes of learning the fundamentals of programming an autonomous agent and applying the acquired theoretical knowledge into practice. The implementation was restricted mostly by the complexity of the subject and the limited amount of time for research and development. Consequently, the result of this effort is a simulated autonomous robot that seeks for a path to the centre of a 16x16 block maze. To achieve this goal the robot uses four fundamental principals: localization, mapping, path planning and motion control. While the robot moves in the maze it uses an array of sensors to avoid obstacles and record their position in the maze using as reference its starting position. Simultaneously, the recorded map of the maze is used to determine the possible paths to the centre every time it steps into the next cell.

## Micromouse in Webots Project 
Author: Emmanouil Stefanakis

Micromouse is a competition where a small mouse robot solves a 16x16 block maze.
#### [COMP513]

### Micromouse
1. Maze Solving: 
Moving/searching around for the best path to reach the center. Use of searching algorithms to compute shortest path.

2. Performance: 
The shortest path is not always the fastest. Straight lines enable the mouse to accelerate.

### Webots
Webots is a professional robot simulator widely used for educational purposes.
